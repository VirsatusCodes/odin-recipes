        <li>1 cup chopped lettuce, divided</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <br>
        <li>Place a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir ground beef, 1/2 cup chopped onion, and garlic in the hot skillet until beef is browned and crumbly, breaking it apart as it cooks, about 8 minutes; drain excess grease. Mix in half the can of diced tomatoes, Worcestershire sauce, chili powder, paprika, oregano, 3/4 teaspoon of cumin, and black pepper. Bring meat mixture to a boil over medium-high heat and cook for 5 minutes, stirring often.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Heat refried beans and 1/4 teaspoon cumin in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Keep beans warm. Mix remaining half of diced tomatoes, beef gravy, and enchilada sauce in a separate saucepan; bring to a boil.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Place tortillas onto a microwave-safe plate and cover with a damp paper towel; microwave tortillas until they are soft and warm, about 30 seconds. Place a warmed tortilla onto a work surface and spoon 1/4 the beef mixture in a line down the center of the tortilla. Layer 1/4 the bean mixture on top of beef layer and spread 1/4 cup of Cheddar cheese over the bean layer. Fold right and left edges of the tortilla over the ends of the filling and roll up tortilla to make a burrito. Place burrito seam side down into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Repeat with remaining tortillas to make 4 burritos.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Pour gravy sauce over the burritos in the baking dish; top with remaining 1 cup Cheddar cheese.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Bake burritos in the preheated oven until the cheese has melted, 15 to 20 minutes. To serve, place each burrito on a serving plate and spoon sauce from baking dish over the burritos. Top each burrito with 1/4 cup sour cream, 1 tablespoon chopped onion and chopped tomato, and 1/4 cup of chopped lettuce.</li>
    </ol>
